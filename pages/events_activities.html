    <h6>The Company Expose</h6>
		<div class = "flex-container_2">
			<img src="../images/companyexposelogo.jpg" alt="Avatar" style="width:40%;height:40%;">

			<p>The Company Expose is the largest event Gamma Nu Eta hosts each year. It is a casual networking event. You get to know the recruiters before the career fair through fun, interactive activities in small groups, and will be a great opportunity to expand your personal network. This year we have a few companies and representatives attending that won’t be present at the career fair, so it is another valuable way to network in our increasingly virtual world. Please note that uploading your resume is optional. We send out the resumes to the companies in attendance after the event. Emails about more info for each specific year are sent out typically in September, and are reserved only for ITWS students. Sign up as soon as you can as space is limited! </p>
		</div>
		<div class = "flex-container_2">
			<p>Companies who have attended in the past include Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Jahnel Group, Naval Nuclear Laboratory, Microsoft, Unisys, and Zones, LLC., and much more!</p>
