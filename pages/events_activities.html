<h1>Gamma Nu Eta Events and Activities</h1>

    <h2>The Company Expose</h2>

        <p>The Company Expose is the largest event Gamma Nu Eta hosts each year. It is a casual networking event. You get to know the recruiters before the career fair through fun, interactive activities in small groups, and will be a great opportunity to expand your personal network. This year we have a few companies and representatives attending that won’t be present at the career fair, so it is another valuable way to network in our increasingly virtual world. Please note that uploading your resume is optional. We send out the resumes to the companies in attendance after the event. Emails about more info for each specific year are sent out typically in September, and are reserved only for ITWS students. Sign up as soon as you can as space is limited! </p>

        <p>Companies who have attended in the past include Johnson & Johnson, General Electric, Jahnel Group, Naval Nuclear Laboratory, Microsoft, Unisys, and Zones, LLC., and much more!</p>

    <h2>GNH Newsletter</h2>

        <p>The newsletter is a once a year mailing that GNH sends to alumni updating them about the goings on in ITWS and RPI at large. Check for updates in your RPI emails for this newsletter to keep up to date with the ITWS community here at RPI!</p>

    <h2>Gamma Nu Eta Tutoring</h2>
        <p><p>Gamma Nu Eta tutoring will take place on Wednesdays from 1pm to 2pm. Tutoring will be in-person at the ITWS Lounge, which is located on the second floor of the Lally Building, right across from Linda’s office. We can also help with any questions that you might have about career development, resumes, as well as just general questions about RPI.
